distance_variation_metrics  - A scatterplot of each edge's reconstructed distance mean against standard deviation
distance_distribution       - Histogram of the distribution of edge mean distances in the reconstruction
distance_distribution_std   - Histogram of the distribution of edge distances standard deviation over multiple reconstructions
distortion                  - Overlapped histograms of the distortions distributions for all reconstructions
knn                         - Scatterplot of the frequency of each KNN value for all reconstructions
knn_over_k                  - Showing KNN as it varies over differnt values of K                               
metric_correlation          - Scatterplot of mean distortions over mean KNN values for each cell individually   
metric_correlation_std      - Same except standard deviation instead of mean                                    
dbscan_calculation**        - Calculates the DBSCAN cluster of each cell-connected beads and modified the reconstruction summary to save how manu clusters each cell generates 
dbscan_analysis             - Barplots showing the distribution of numbers of cluster as well as percentage of 1-cluster cells 
normal_vs_morphed*          - Compares the distortion distributions between morphed and unmorphed coordinates 
cell_types                  - Violin plots of the KNN distributions separated by cell types
cpd                         - Scatterplot of the reconstructed distances against the reference distances - can be very memory intensive for large networks, activate "subsampling" if that is the case
umi_vs_dist                 - Scatterplot of the reconstructed distance vs the number of UMIS associated to that edge
knn_over_density            - Scatterplot of the KNN value over cell density
knn_over_umis               - scatterplot of the KNN value of the sum of UMIS for each cell
per_cell_cpd                - per cell PCD - WIP
metric_heatmaps             - Heatmaps of the reference positions coloured by density, UMI density, KNN, and degree
